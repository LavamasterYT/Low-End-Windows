A low end Windows

# Whats this?
This is a low end explorer.exe, it essentially replaces your desktop with a stripped down version. It ***will*** include a:
- Dock
- "Start Menu"
- A functional desktop
- Applications to go along with this

This is still a WIP so expect some features to be added/removed and stuff.
